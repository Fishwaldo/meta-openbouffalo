This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-openbouffalo layer.

To build a image for the BL808 based boards (pine64 ox64 or Sipeed M1S) run:

```
. ./setup.sh
```

This will checkout all the necessary layers and place you in the build directory ready to build a new image
then run
```
bitbake openbouffalo-image
```
and after a while your image will be placed in build/tmp/deploy/images/bl808/

This repository also uses the Shared Shate and HashServer hosted at openbouffalo.my-ho.st to speed up the build process.

Please see the corresponding sections below for additional details.
